# JUMP Cell Painting data demonstration

[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/552371375.svg)](https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/552371375)

This workspace provides Jupyter notebooks demonstrating how to work with data from the collection of [Cell Painting](https://jump-cellpainting.broadinstitute.org/cell-painting) image datasets generated by the [JUMP-CP Consortium](https://jump-cellpainting.broadinstitute.org/).

All the data is hosted on the Cell Painting Gallery on the Registry of Open Data on AWS ([https://registry.opendata.aws/cellpainting-gallery/](https://registry.opendata.aws/cellpainting-gallery/)). If you'd like to take a look at (a subset of) the data interactively, the [JUMP-CP Data Explorer](https://phenaid.ardigen.com/jumpcpexplorer/) by Ardigen and the [JUMP-CP Data Portal](https://www.springdiscovery.com/jump-cp) by Spring Discovery provide portals to do so. More details regarding the current status of the data release can be found on https://github.com/jump-cellpainting/datasets

## Details about the data

The notebooks in this workspace operation on a principal dataset of 116k chemical and >15k genetic perturbations the partners created in tandem (`cpg0016`), split across 12 data-generating centers. Human U2OS osteosarcoma cells are used.

* Most data components (images, raw CellProfiler output, single-cell profiles, aggregated CellProfiler profiles) are available from 12 sources for the principal dataset. Each source corresponds to a unique data generating center (except `source_7` and `source_13`, which were from the same center).
* Please see  https://github.com/jump-cellpainting/datasets for more details regarding additional data planned for release.

## Notebooks

The following tutorial notebooks were obtained from the [JUMP Cell Painting datasets GitHub repository](https://github.com/jump-cellpainting/datasets):

1. `workspace_setup.ipynb`: run this notebook first to install the Python dependencies and metadata. Takes less than a minute to run.
2. `sample_notebook.ipynb`: demonstrates how to load the data in the principal dataset and visualize it. Takes less than a minute to run.

Recommended environment settings to run the notebooks are below:

Runtime Environment |	Value
------------------------------|-------
CPU Minimum |	1
Disksize Minimum	| 50 GB
Memory Minimum	| 3.75 GB
Environment |  Defalut (GATK, Python, R)

## How to use this workspace
1. Clone this workspace and open the Notebooks tab.
2. Click on notebook `workspace_setup.ipynb` and follow prompts to create a runtime environment Note: if you don't have a runtime environment running, it will take a few minutes to create and start.
3. Run all cells in notebook  `workspace_setup.ipynb` to install the Python dependencies and metadata. Takes less than a minute to run to completion.
4. Open and run all cells in notebook `sample_notebook.ipynb` to load the data in the principal dataset and visualize it. Takes less than a minute to run to completion.

### Citing the JUMP resource as a whole

All the data is released with CC0 1.0 Universal (CC0 1.0).
Still, professional ethics require that you cite the associated publication.
Please use the following format to cite this resource as a whole:

_We used the JUMP Cell Painting datasets (Chandrasekaran et al., 2022b), available from the Cell Painting Gallery on the Registry of Open Data on AWS ([https://registry.opendata.aws/cellpainting-gallery/](https://registry.opendata.aws/cellpainting-gallery/))._

For applications which require a DOI, this repository is archived at <https://zenodo.org/record/7628768> automatically upon each release.
The permanent DOI is 10.5281/zenodo.7628768; individual versions will also be assigned DOIs, see the badge at the top of this README for the most recent DOI.

Please note that the JUMP whole-project manuscript (Chandrasekaran et al., 2022b) is currently in preparation.

### Citing individual JUMP datasets

To cite individual JUMP Cell Painting datasets, please follow the guidelines in the Cell Painting Gallery citation [guide](https://github.com/broadinstitute/cellpainting-gallery/#citationlicense).
Examples are as follows:

_We used the dataset cpg0001 (Cimini et al., 2022), available from the Cell Painting Gallery on the Registry of Open Data on AWS (<https://registry.opendata.aws/cellpainting-gallery/>)._

_We used the dataset cpg0000 (Chandrasekaran et al., 2022a), available from the Cell Painting Gallery on the Registry of Open Data on AWS (<https://registry.opendata.aws/cellpainting-gallery/>)._
