# Terra workspace for JUMP Cell Painting data demonstration

To use the Terra workspace to explore several analyses involving the `cpg0016` data release, navigate to the workspace (https://app.terra.bio link TBD) and follow the instructions on the workspace dashboard.

This subdirectory holds several items hosted in that workspace:
* [workspace_dashboard.md](./workspace_dashboard.md) the contents of the dashboard of the Terra workspace
* [workspace_setup.ipynb](./workspace_setup.ipynb) a notebook to install the Python dependencies and JUMP/CP metadata onto a Terra Cloud Environment
